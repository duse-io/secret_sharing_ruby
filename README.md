# SecretSharing

> **Warning:** This implementation has not been tested in production nor has it
> been examined by a security audit. All uses are your own responsibility.

A ruby implementation of shamir's secret sharing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'secret_sharing'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install secret_sharing

## Usage

	require 'secret_sharing'
	shares = SecretSharing.split_secret('secret', 2, 3) # => [...]
	length = shares.length # => 3
	secret = SecretSharing.recover_secret(shares[0..1]) # => 'my secret'

This implementation can also handle non-ascii characters, however, the charset
will be visible in the calculated shares. Thus splitting ascii only strings is
"more" secure. (but always remember, shamir's secret sharing alone is not
secure)

## Compatible libraries

Since this implementation is special in some ways most [Shamirâ€™s Secret
Sharing](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%E2%80%99s_Secret_Sharing)
libraries are not compatible. The only library that is compatible as of now is
[duse-io/secret-sharing-dart](https://github.com/duse-io/secret-sharing-dart).

We do have [integration
tests](https://github.com/duse-io/lib-integration-tests) that make sure the
libraries work with each other.
